### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Josh, a passionate software developer and mechanical engineer from Vancouver Island Canada. I am currently refining my software and web development skills and have recently completed a full-stack coding course with MIT xPro. I am proficient in C++, Javascript, CSS, HTML, React, Express, and MongoDB. I also have a background in mechanical engineering and am well versed in control systems, sensors, electro-mechanical, and prototyping using Arduino. 

If you have a website you need help with, or if you need support on a product you are developing, I'd love to help you out! Feel free to send me a message :) As a developer I seem to bounce between hardware and software projects, although as of late I have been hooked on web development and creative coding.. so much to learn, so much to do!!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on data logging web app for electric motor performance. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning p5, and am absolutely hooked on creative coding and data visualization.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that will uplift humanity!!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking to learn more, and open to guidance from a web dev guru. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: joshseeley@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love writing and producing music have completed a professional certificate in music production from Berklee. I am eager to blend creative coding with music production.
